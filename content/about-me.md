`Hello World!`🌍 My name is **Raktim Deka** (pronouns: he/him), and I’m 25 years young! 
 I’m all about **minimalism** and **matte black** everything—because why settle for less 
 when you can keep it sleek and simple?

My love for tech started with Sony’s handheld consoles. I was one of the lucky kids who owned a PlayStation Portable (PSP) back in the day. 
But here’s the twist: the official game disks were crazy expensive! 💸 So, my cousin and I dove into the wild world of modified firmware—basically hacking the PSP to play games directly from the SD card. We even had to dig into hexdump files to figure out the exact model type. It was like a tech treasure hunt! 🕵️‍♂️ This adventure taught me about memory allocation, hexdumps, and a bit of low-level programming. Pretty cool, right?

Fast forward to today, I’m a Cybersecurity Analyst at Wipro Limited, where I work on securing enterprise systems and applications. I specialize in integrating authentication protocols like OpenID Connect, OAuth 2.0, and SAML 2.0, and I’ve built custom scripts to automate workflows and enhance security. Think of me as the guy who keeps things running smoothly while making sure they’re locked down tight! 🔒💻

Outside of work, I’m all about programming, problem-solving, Linux, and automation. I’m also a huge advocate for free and open-source software (FOSS). Seriously, open source is the secret sauce behind almost all the tech we use today!

Let’s geek out together and build something awesome! 😄
