`Hello World!`. My name is Raktim Deka. My pronouns are <u>he/him</u>. 
I am 23 years young. My keywords are **Minimalism** and **Matte Black Everything**

My interest in tech started with handheld consoles from *Sony*. I was one of the few lucky kids
to own a playstation portable back in the day. One major challenge I faced was the fact that the
proprietary game disks costed a lot of money. With the help of my cousin we figured out that
there were modified firmwares out in the internet when flashed could read games directly from the
SD card, that it used. Armed with this knowledge, we had to open a compiled hexdump file to check for
the exact model type to match with the modified firmware. Turns out hacking together parts of the original
file taught me a lot about memory allocations, hexdumps and very little low level programming.

Fast forward to current day, I am working in a service based multinational company
as a **Level 1 System Engineer**, on *vulnerability management* & *remediation services* for 
enterprise systems and applications.

Besides corporate, I talk about <u>programming</u>, <u>problem solving</u>, <u>linux</u> and <u>automation</u>.
I also spread the use of _free-opensource-software_ i.e FOSS technologies and how open source is the backbone 
of nearly all software technology.
